# Operating Platforms
Portfolio and final project different Operating Platforms course

This project was for client "The Gaming Room." Introduced to different approaches they can use as they expand their game onto various operating systems. Explained the integration of the client’s game in a distributed environment and how to apply the client’s needs to the architectures of the different operating platforms available.

The peoject being worked on was a game called Draw it or Lose it. Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit.

This design document gives a good summary of the project and lays out design constraints, system architecture view, domain model, evaluation of game outlook on mulitple operating systems, and developer recomendations. 

If I had to choose one part of your work on these documents to reviseI would pick storage and memory mangament. As I think that is pretty important and could drastically change how the game runs. I would research it a little more, as I recomended cloud storage for images, so I would dive deeper into how that could work. 

Designing software was a step by step approach but I think it could be tested and strenghtened. I recomend following developer recomendations for a spec doc in the future and working as a team is also great.
